# Logic.ly Faster

A utility for connecting [Logic.ly](http://logic.ly/) nodes faster, and perhaps more, in the future.

## Usage

 1. Install [AHK (AutoHotkey)](https://autohotkey.com/).
 2. Open up `logicly-faster.ahk` in AHK. (The installer may have already associated .ahk files accordingly. If not, right-click and "Open with..."

    If you see a green "H" icon in your systray (on the Windows taskbar, near the clock), then you've succeeded, probably.
 3. Make sure you're in selection (pointer) mode and not the pan (hand) mode.

 4. Press Ctrl+Shift+L, and follow the remaining instructions.
 
## Notes

Don't get scared off by AHK. AHK is just a lightweight utility for automation actions on Windows. (If you've ever worked with Excel macros, like that.) For example, with AHK, you can write a script that goes, _"Whenever Ctrl+Alt+H is pressed, open up my browser and go to [http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com)`."_ Another thing AHK can do though, is automate mouse movements! So we can write a script that goes, _"Move the mouse to (a,b), click, and while holding click (to drag), move the mouse to (x,y), and let go."_ Lo and behold:
