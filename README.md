# Logic.ly Faster

A utility for connecting [Logic.ly](http://logic.ly/) nodes faster, and perhaps more, in the future.

# Requirements

This is an [AHK (AutoHotkey)](https://autohotkey.com/) script. Don't run away. All that means is you need to install AHK and open up 

`logicly-faster.ahk` in AHK. (You know, that whole "Open with..." dialog in Windows.) Unfortunately though, AHK is Windows-only. So I 

guess PC users are getting their homeworks done a little faster this semester. Logicly faster, that is.

Okay, in a few more words, AHK is a lightweight program that allows you to automate your Windows actions. (Kind of like Excel macros, 

except for Windows.) For example, with AHK, you can write a script that goes, _"Whenever Ctrl+Alt+L is pressed, open up Filezilla, 

connect to `ftp.hedgehog-unicorn.com`, and navigate to `/htdocs`."_ Well, another thing AHK can do is automate mouse movements; we can 

write a script that goes, _"Move the mouse to _(a,b)_, click, and while holding click (to drag), move the mouse to (x,y), and let go."_ 

You get the idea.
